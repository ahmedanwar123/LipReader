## Required Libraries
Before running the Lip Reader project, make sure to install the required libraries. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy matplotlib imageio
```
## Required Libraries

pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy matplotlib imageio

OpenCV (cv2): Used for image and video processing.
TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for building and training models.
NumPy: Library for numerical operations, particularly useful for handling arrays and matrices.
Matplotlib: Used for creating visualizations and plots.
ImageIO: Library for reading and writing image data.

## Installation
  1.Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedanwar123/LipReader.git
cd LipReader
```
  2.Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
  1.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook LipReader.ipynb
```

## Architecture
The lip reading model architecture utilizes a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction from video frames. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled lip movement sequences.

## Data Preparation
Prepare your training data by organizing video sequences and corresponding labels. The dataset should include English language speakers showcasing various lip movements.

## Training
To train the model, follow these steps:

Organize your dataset.
Run the training script in the notebook.
Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set using the provided evaluation script in the notebook.

## Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run streamlitapp.py
```

## Future Work
Language Expansion: Include support for Arabic language lip reading.
Enhanced Model: Experiment with more advanced 3D convolutional architectures.
Real-time Processing: Implement real-time lip reading capabilities.
Multilingual Support: Extend language support to other languages.# Lip Reader
